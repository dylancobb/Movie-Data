# Planning
- The project will include a panel that displays the data of a selected movie
    - By default this will display the data of the first movie on the list
- An interactable list of movies will appear beneath this panel, with buttons to move between different items in the list, create items, delete items, and bring up another panel to edit the data of a given movie.
- Aesthetically, some kind of banner and footer might be nice, but given there is a lot of data to display they should be small/unobtrusive enough that all or most of the data can fit on a desktop screen, and not too much scrolling is needed on phone displays.
